So you wanna know something about me, there's not much. I'm just a Czech kid wanting to achieve his dreams.

I like mountainbiking, cars, trucks etc. However out of all of them my love for trucks is the strongest. My love for them probably started when I was 4 and my dad let me in his volvo fm. Fast foward 11 years, few thousand kilometers driven with my dad, several hundered hours in Euro Truck Simulator 2 and here I am.

I'm not the best at learning but there are few subjects that I like, and English is one of them. Since I want to become truck driver one day I thought that it would be nice to have an English certificate, possibly making it easier for me to get a job in foreign countries. And that's exactly what I did! On may 26th I succeeded on my Cambridge English exams, granting me a B1 certificate. I'm planning on doing a B2 exam as well in the future, abecause from what I was told it's a lot harder and I like challenges.

But that's enough of school, let's talk about something more fun like mountainbiking! I really like mountainbiking because I can just pack some water and food and drive to another city or explore new country roads, not having to worry about running out of gas or making it in time at the train station. I'm pretty sure that when I get my drivers licence I won't be on my MTB so much but that's to be expected.

I got into web development through my good friend [Foxx](https://foxxeek.github.io/), he was making a game for a gamejam that a was hosted by a smaller you could say underground youtuber [Mr. Snailovitch](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuRH_90plMjyR3cZm7u6GEw), I wanted to help him but I'm not good at making sprites or art so I offered him to make a website, I thought that I could find a good web builder but of course, they're all paid so I had to learn HTML and CSS, the website is currently not being used as Foxx has his own website now. And that's how I got into web development.

If there's something else you would like to know about me then go ahead and contact me.
