Lately I feel like my luck has run out, I've had my phone for 9 months and now in the span of a few weeks I managed to break the back glass and destroy the oled panel. Worst thing? I always have a phone case on so I never got to know when that happened and that oled? It didn't even fall on it! It just slid out of my pocket on the back yet it somehow messed the display up. Right now I'm on a train to České Budějovice to get it fixed and that kinda scares me. See, I've been to České Budějovice many times but never on foot, alone. I at least think I know what bus I should take but it's stressful nontheless. Thank you for listening to my little rant, see you next time.
