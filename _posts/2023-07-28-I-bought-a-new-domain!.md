I have finally bought a custom domain and now I'll actually be able to remember what url my site has!

## Why would I get a .xyz domain?

If I were to get a .com, .net or .org, then I would spend significantly more and it wouldn't be that nerdy. Like who else uses .xyz?

## Setting everything up.

When I was buying my domain on [porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) I was told that I could buy the domain for around one dollar for a year since I was a new customer but everytime I went to check-out I got an error saying to try again and the new customer discount is being removed, it was only a dollar more so I just bought it anyways.

I would have thought that setting up a custom domain on github pages would be easy but no. I've had to create some DNS configurations and then get github to verify some stuff and yet I couldn't access my site, after poking around for a few minutes I eventually got it to work but I was expecting it to be easier.

## Conclusion

From now on I'll use [kufd00m.xyz](http://www.kufd00m.xyz/) maybe in a year I'll get a different domain but it would be nice to stick with what works.
