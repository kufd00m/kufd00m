I’ve finally found a good-looking, easy-to-navigate and optimised blog. <br>
It took me some time to find a template that fits my needs but I settled on [Moonwalk](https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk) by [Abhinav Saxena](https://www.abhinav.co/). It’s a pretty simple design reminding me of MediaWiki for some reason.

## Why this template?

I wanted something that could serve as a portfolio and as a personal blog and this was the one template that fit the criteria. I’ve thought about making a WordPress website but those are super easy to hack if you don’t keep them updated, so Jekyll it is.

## But why even Jekyll?

A retired member of our [VTC](https://truckersmp.com/vtc/25294-energy)(Virtual Trucking Company) was also trying out web development and while snooping around his creation I found a link to some Jekyll website template from which I found the creators Github and then came across [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/), A pretty large database of themes that are mostly free to use.

## Conclusion

I hope that this website will last and that I’ll keep this blog active. As for what I will be posting expect some more personal posts more focused on my life. But of course, I’ll try to mix it up so that there are even some posts about the things I do outside of my personal life like for example my position in Line of Energy as a general manager.
