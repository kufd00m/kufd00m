I'm so f-ing happy right now, I was a little worried about my future classmates but as it turns out they're awesome. Still don't know them very well but in the short time we've knows each other it's been awesome. A few of them have really funny surnames, translated into English there are people names Joker, Jester, Shoe Rack and Heil xD. Even our floor supervisor turned out to be very chill. Today we've been to Tesco to do some shopping since as it turns out they don't supply toilet paper to us but at least we won't have some super thin paper that rips when you wipe your ass. On our way back from tesco I felt like I'm gonna die, it's 30 degrees here and I managed to miss two busses, eventually we got home though and after chilling for a few hours we decided to go find a tobacco shop near. It's one station away but one of my roommates got fooled by some idiots that it's actually 3 stations down and I couldn't convince him, so after a small trip I prooved to him it's where I said it is and we went back to that station, bought some stuff and went back home.
